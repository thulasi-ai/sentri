/**
 * healingPersistence.js — Persist self-healing events from test execution
 *
 * During test execution, the self-healing runtime (injected via
 * getSelfHealingHelperCode) accumulates healing events — records of which
 * selector strategy succeeded or failed for each interaction.
 *
 * This module extracts the duplicated "walk events and call
 * recordHealing / recordHealingFailure" pattern that appeared in both the
 * success and failure branches of executeTest.
 *
 * Exports:
 *   persistHealingEvents(testId, events)
