and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **AUTO-014** — Tests can declare dependencies so prerequisite tests run first and downstream tests are skipped with clear upstream-failure badges.
- **MNT-015** — Warm Playwright browser-process pool with per-`browserType` FIFO waiter queue and `BROWSER_POOL_SIZE` env knob (default `max(PARALLEL_WORKERS, MAX_WORKERS, WORKER_CONCURRENCY, 2)`).
- **MNT-015** — Per-workspace cost-weighted AI rate limiter (AI mutations = 10 units, regular calls = 1) on `POST /chat`, `/projects/:id/crawl`, `/projects/:id/tests/generate`, `/tests/:testId/fix`, `/settings/agent-roles/:role/test`.
- **MNT-015** — IETF-standard `RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining`, `RateLimit-Reset` response headers on every AI route + `Retry-After` on 429s, so clients can back off proactively (matches GitHub / Stripe / OpenAI convention).
- **MNT-015** — Pool telemetry: `app_browser_pool_size`, `app_browser_pool_in_use`, `app_browser_pool_acquires_total{outcome}`, `app_browser_pool_acquire_wait_seconds` histogram, `app_browser_pool_disconnects_total`, `app_ai_rate_limited_total{workspace_role}`.
- **MNT-015** — Browser-disconnect listener evicts the cached handle on Chromium OOM kill / CDP socket drop so the next acquire relaunches instead of handing out a dead browser.
- **MNT-015** — Two new Prometheus alerts in `monitoring/prometheus/alerts.yml`: `BrowserPoolStarvation` (>90% pool saturation for 5 min) and `BrowserPoolDisconnects` (any unexpected disconnect in 15 min).
- **MNT-015** — Graceful-shutdown drains warm browsers before queue / Redis teardown in `backend/src/index.js` + `backend/src/worker.js`; pool is sealed post-drain so SIGTERM can't leak a zombie Chromium.

### Changed

- **MNT-015** — AI rate limiter consolidated to a single per-workspace token bucket; cost-weighting alone differentiates AI mutations from regular calls. The legacy `AI_RATE_LIMIT_REGULAR_PER_MIN` env var is deprecated and silently ignored.

### Performance

- **MNT-015** — Browser test execution reuses warm browser processes instead of launching a cold Chromium per test; each test still gets a fresh `BrowserContext` for per-tenant storage / video / tracing isolation.

## [1.9.1] — 2026-05-30

### Security

- **CR-003 / TD-003** — Helm chart now refuses to render with the bundled `change-me` placeholder for `JWT_SECRET` or `ENCRYPTION_KEY`. `helm install` / `helm upgrade` aborts with a human-readable error pointing operators at the override syntax, so a default `helm install sentri ./helm/sentri` can no longer silently ship predictable JWTs and a known AES key to a cluster.
- **§10.2 partial — image hardening shipped, scan gate deferred.** Backend Dockerfile adds `apt-get upgrade -y` to the base layer so Debian security-pool fixes (`libcap2`, `libgnutls30` — 2 CRITICAL + 4 HIGH) land at build time. OpenTelemetry dependencies bumped to clear the matching npm-pkg CVEs: `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node` 0.53 → 0.75, `@opentelemetry/sdk-node` + `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http` 0.53 → 0.217 (clears 14 HIGH). The OTel surface we use (`NodeSDK`, `getNodeAutoInstrumentations`, `OTLPTraceExporter`, `trace.getSpan`, `context.active`, `span.setAttributes`) is unchanged across the bump. The Trivy gate itself is **not** wired into CI yet — the remaining 15 HIGH CVEs are all in transitive deps of `playwright` / `@playwright/test` (`cross-spawn`, `glob`, `minimatch`, `protobufjs`, `tar`) which need a Playwright version bump + E2E re-validation in a dedicated security PR.
- **§7.3** — Documented the residual DNS-rebinding TOCTOU window in `backend/src/utils/ssrfGuard.js#safeFetch`. The pre-fetch DNS lookup and undici's connect-time resolution are two independent lookups; Node's `fetch` doesn't expose a hook for the connect-time address. JSDoc now explicitly notes the limitation, the defence-in-depth (`redirect: "error"` + outbound network policy), and the eventual fix path (custom undici dispatcher with a `lookup` hook). No code change — future investigators won't re-litigate the gap as a new finding.

### Added

- **AUTO-014** — Tests can declare dependencies so prerequisite tests run first and downstream tests are skipped with clear upstream-failure badges.
- **CR-004 / TD-004** — `backend/scripts/lint-migrations.mjs` fails CI on any new duplicate numeric prefix in `backend/src/database/migrations/`. Existing collisions (`007`, `015`, `021`, `035`, `036`, `037`, `054`, `059`) are grandfathered with a warning; new collisions exit non-zero. Wired into `.github/workflows/ci.yml` as a backend job step.
- **CR-009** — Per-run, per-process SSE listener cap (`SSE_MAX_LISTENERS_PER_RUN`, default 50) in `backend/src/routes/sse.js`. New connections beyond the cap return HTTP 503 with `Retry-After` instead of growing `runListeners` without bound on connection leaks.
- **§11.2** — Shipped `monitoring/grafana/sentri-overview.json` — 15-panel operations dashboard covering API RED metrics, run pipeline outcomes, BullMQ queue depth, AI provider health (calls / errors / p99 latency / cost / cache hit rate), and Node.js runtime gauges. Each alerting panel is title-tagged with the matching alert from `monitoring/prometheus/alerts.yml` so on-call engineers can pivot alert → panel in one click. Import via Grafana UI or file-provision per `monitoring/grafana/README.md`.
- **§11.3** — SSE per-listener backpressure cap (`SSE_MAX_WRITABLE_BYTES`, default 1 MiB) in `backend/src/routes/sse.js`. Slow consumers (mobile on throttled networks, paused tabs) are now dropped on the next write when their socket has more than the cap queued in Node's stream layer, instead of growing process memory until the run finishes. Clients reconnect automatically with EventSource's normal retry, picking up from the snapshot.
- **§17 #7 / TD-017** — New `backend/src/middleware/validateRequest.js` ships reusable `validateBody` / `validateQuery` / `validateParams` Zod middleware with a consistent RFC-9457-style `validation_failed` error shape. Foundation for replacing the 8+ hand-rolled input-guard phrasings in `routes/*.js` incrementally. Includes branch-covered unit tests registered in `backend/tests/run-tests.js`.
- **§17 #7 / TD-017 pilot** — `POST /workspaces/switch` and `POST /workspaces/current/members` migrated to `validateBody`. Side-benefit: the new schema rejects whitespace-only `workspaceId` payloads (the old `if (!targetId || typeof targetId !== "string")` truthy check let `"   "` through) and lowercases the invite email at the schema layer instead of at the lookup site. `InviteMemberSchema.role` uses `z.preprocess` to coerce `null` / `""` → `undefined` BEFORE `.default("viewer")` so frontends sending unselected-dropdown values get the same fallback behaviour as the pre-Zod `role \|\| "viewer"` guard. Two routes done; remaining route files migrate as they're touched.
- **§17 #7 / TD-017 wire-shape** — `validateRequest.js` now puts the first issue's human-readable message in `body.error` (so frontend toasts that show `err.message` display actionable text like "valid email is required" instead of the machine code `"validation_failed"`). The machine identifier moves to `body.code = "validation_failed"`, matching the rest of the codebase's `{ error: <text>, code: <STABLE_ID> }` pattern.
- **CR-009 + §11.3 regression test** — New `backend/tests/sse-caps.test.js` locks in the SSE listener cap and per-listener backpressure behaviour against future refactors. Covers delivery to healthy listeners, the `writableLength > 1 MiB` slow-consumer drop, the under-cap continuation path, the `type=done` cleanup, and the `runListeners.size` contract the route's 503 gate depends on. Registered in `backend/tests/run-tests.js`.
- **§17 #1 / TD-012 god-object pilot** — Extracted `parseCsvRows` + `clampIterationCap` (~80 lines) out of the 1,941-line `backend/src/routes/tests.js` into a dedicated `backend/src/utils/csv.js` module. The route file now imports from there; the `__testables` export still re-exports both so the existing `tests/fixture-iteration.test.js` passes unchanged. New module-direct unit tests at `backend/tests/csv.test.js` cover header parsing, CRLF, escaped quotes, blank-row dropping, and the `[1, 100]` clamp branches.

### Fixed

- **Bundle-B fix #1** — Network logs now pair request/response by Playwright's `Request` object (WeakMap) instead of by URL. Two concurrent same-URL requests with staggered responses no longer corrupt each other's entries.
- **Bundle-B fix #2** — Per-test timeout reject now stops the CDP screencast BEFORE force-closing the page, so a timed-out test no longer produces unhandled rejections from a dead CDP session.
- **Bundle-B fix #3** — Per-test video cleanup migrated from sync `fs.*Sync` to `fs/promises`. The hot cleanup hook no longer blocks the event loop on every test, unblocking SSE progress events on large parallel runs.
- **Bundle-B fix #4** — `networkLogs` now ring-bound at 500 entries per test (oldest evicted on push). Long-running tests on chatty SPAs can no longer accumulate tens of thousands of entries and OOM the worker.
- **Bundle-B fix #5** — Browser-health probe before each test (`browser.isConnected()`) surfaces a structured `ERR_BROWSER_DISCONNECTED` error instead of a cryptic "Target closed" deep inside `newContext`. Parent runner can recognise it and restart + retry the test once.
- **Bundle-B fix #6** — Per-run downloads directory under `os.tmpdir()/sentri-downloads/<runId>/step<N>`. Wiped on cleanup regardless of test outcome; no longer bleeds across parallel runs.
- **Bundle-B fix #7** — Stage-7 pixelmatch decline path now calls `recordHealingFailure(testId, action, label)` so consistently-CV-failing hints get demoted via the existing `failCount` cap.
- **Bundle-B fix #8** — New `app_healing_hints_discarded_total{reason}` Prometheus counter bumps every time `getHealingHint` / `getHealingHistoryForTest` rejects a row because of a `STRATEGY_VERSION` mismatch. Operators can alert on a stale-hint backlog after a strategy reorder instead of guessing.
- **Bundle-B fix #9** — `buildPierceLocator` renamed to `buildCssLocator` and the misleading "css:pierce engine" comment removed. Playwright's css engine pierces *open* shadow roots by default and cannot reach closed shadow roots; the function name now matches what the code actually does. Backward-compat: callers using the legacy `pierce:` selector prefix continue to work.
- **Bundle-B fix #10** — TTL decay (`HEALING_HINT_DECAY_DAYS`, default 7 days) for stale healing hints. A capped hint whose last `succeededAt` is older than the decay window resets to `failCount: 0` on next read so the strategy gets another chance, instead of being permanently dead.
- **Bundle-B fix #11** — `__valueIntents` map in the self-healing runtime now writes both the bare `<action>::<label>` key (last-write-wins, used by the host re-action path) AND a step-suffixed key (`fill::Name::stepN`). Two same-label fills with different values both retain their value intent in the audit trail.
- **Bundle-B fix #12** — `launchBrowser()` failure inside `exploreStates` now wrapped in a structured try that logs the project ID and tuning before rethrowing. Production logs across hundreds of concurrent explorations are now attributable instead of bubbling raw.
- **Bundle-B fix #13** — State-explorer login `waitForLoadState` calls migrated from `networkidle` to `domcontentloaded` (matches the codebase convention enforced by `feedbackLoop.js#TIMEOUT`). SPAs with continuous background polling no longer trip the 10-second login timeout.
- **Bundle-B fix #14** — State-explorer `GLOBAL_TIMEOUT_MS` capped at 15 minutes regardless of `maxStates × actionTimeout × 2`. Operators tuning `maxStates=100, actionTimeout=15000` now see a 15-minute budget (was 50 minutes) and a log line documenting the cap.
- **Bundle-B fix #15** — `restorePage` returns `true` on success / `false` when both goto attempts fail. Form, standalone-action, and bot-block branches all break out of the inner loop on `false` so the next action no longer runs against an unknown page state.
- **Bundle-B fix #16** — `crawlLinks` now dedupes extracted links by URL and caps to 50 per page (same-path-prefix prioritised). Link-dense pages (e-commerce, sitemaps) no longer blow per-run budget on a single page.
- **Bundle-B fix #17** — `executeAction` for `fill` no longer calls `el.fill("")` before `el.fill(value)`. The intermediate empty-fill was a no-op that fired an extra onChange event on React Hook Form / controlled inputs and double-counted field-touch metrics.
- **Bundle-B fix #18** — `syncRunPages` throttled to one DB write + SSE broadcast per 500ms, with a forced final flush at end of exploration. Novel-state-heavy explorations no longer flood the SSE channel.
- **Bundle-B fix #19** — Five new state-explorer Prometheus metrics: `app_explorer_states_discovered_total`, `app_explorer_actions_attempted_total{type}`, `app_explorer_bot_block_skips_total`, `app_explorer_global_timeout_total`, and `app_explorer_duration_seconds` histogram. (`states_discovered_total` is labelless to avoid unbounded `projectId` cardinality — per-project attribution lives in the structured `✨ New state` run log.)
- **Bundle-B fix #20** — `detectSignupIntent` flow now tracks `mailboxFlowExecutedActions` and `standardFlowExecutedActions` separately and concatenates them on fallback, so a signup-flow throw partway through fills retains the mailbox-flow audit instead of being overwritten by the standard-flow fallback.
- Autonomous agent orchestrator now threads `replyToId` across supervisor handoffs, tool_call, and tool_result envelopes so the run-detail conversation timeline reconstructs the multi-step thread as a connected chain instead of orphan roots.
- Vision healing now emits `vision_pixelmatch_failed` and `vision_llm_failed` healer→reviewer envelopes on declined heals (sub-threshold or provider outage), so the run timeline records every heal attempt rather than going silent between the failure and the next stage.
- New `app_reviewer_verdict_downgraded_total{reason}` Prometheus counter bumps on every reviewer-verdict downgrade so operators can alert on reviewer-prompt drift or hallucinated testIds.
- Reviewer↔author loop now honours envelope-shape `{ intent: "revise" }` as a request for revision (mirroring the existing `verdict: "revise"` remap). Pre-fix a reviewer returning the envelope-shape token silently normalised to `accept`, burning the requested revision round.
- Post-generation pipeline resets `run.secretScanBlocked` at entry, so a re-entry on the same run (multi-batch generation) no longer carries a stale `true` from an earlier batch. CI consumers reading the flag now see the canonical post-run value.
- Post-generation pipeline now re-scores test quality AFTER healing transforms (was before), so the Review Queue's "why was this drafted?" explainer and the auto-approval `confidenceScore` reflect the persisted code shape. Pre-fix tests rewritten from `page.getByRole(...).click()` to `safeClick(...)` carried a stale `selector.semantic` reward that no longer matched the saved code.
- Feedback-loop improvement prompt now caps the embedded element-snapshot JSON at 8 KB to prevent verbose page snapshots from blowing past the LLM's context window during auto-regeneration.
- Feedback-loop now surfaces non-abort regeneration failures via a structured warn log + new `app_feedback_loop_regeneration_failures_total{reason}` Prometheus counter (parse_error / provider_error / internal_error). Pre-fix the auto-regen catch path silently swallowed every non-abort error, making a sustained provider outage look like "regeneration just isn't helping".
- Flaky-test detection now scans only the most recent 50 runs per project (was: entire history). Long-lived projects with thousands of runs no longer pay an O(history) scan on every feedback-loop pass. Pass `{ maxRuns: 0 }` to opt back into the full-history scan.
- Deduplicator's fuzzy / semantic layers now respect the `scenario` field: positive and negative coverage of the same flow on the same URL (e.g. "Login with valid credentials" vs "Login with invalid credentials") are no longer falsely collapsed. Tests with missing `scenario` keep the prior dedup behaviour.
- Deduplicator's fuzzy / semantic comparison is now bucketed by `sourceUrl` before the O(n²) layer, so large multi-page test batches run faster (1000 tests across 10 URLs now dedupe in under 2 seconds). Pure perf — correctness is preserved.
- Deduplicator's semantic-similarity layer now uses real TF-IDF (smoothed, computed over the per-batch document frequency) instead of TF-only. Common domain vocabulary ("button", "input", "field", etc.) no longer drives false-positive duplicate matches across structurally different tests.
- Assertion enhancer's "has-no-assertions" check now ignores `expect(` mentions inside string literals and comments. Pre-fix a generated test like `console.log("expect(loaded)")` with zero real assertions slipped past the enhancer and shipped without any quality checks; post-fix the enhancer correctly injects assertions on those tests.
- Assertion enhancer's injection anchor now tolerates trailing newlines, line comments, and block comments after the test's closing `});`. Pre-fix a generated test ending with `});\n// generated by gpt-4o` silently skipped assertion injection because the regex anchored on end-of-string.
- Assertion enhancer's AUTH and `security` templates now scope the "no 'Invalid'/'error' on page" negative-text check to dedicated error regions (`[role="alert"]`, `.error`, `.field-error`, etc.) instead of `body`. Pre-fix legitimate UI text like "Invalid email format" form hints or "Error Reports" admin links could false-positive these assertions on a successful-login page.
- Test validator's `VALID_PAGE_ACTIONS` allowlist now recognises advanced Playwright APIs that pre-fix were rejected as "invalid Playwright method": `pdf`, `setContent`, `addScriptTag`, `addStyleTag`, `bringToFront`, `setOfflineMode`, `exposeFunction`, `exposeBinding`, and locator combinators (`and`, `or`, `clear`). AI-generated tests using these methods now pass validation.
- Test validator's assertion regex no longer catastrophically backtracks on minified single-line test bodies. The expect-target capture is now bounded to 2 KB (stops at statement boundaries), so validation time stays linear instead of spiking on large or pathological inputs.
- Bot-detection patterns now live in a single shared module (`backend/src/utils/botDetection.js`) consumed by both the post-run failure classifier and the state explorer's crawl-time gate. Pre-fix the two lists drifted: the explorer treated legitimate admin paths under `/blocked-*` (e.g. `/users/blocked-users`) as anti-bot landing pages and abandoned mid-crawl. Both consumers now share the path-boundary-anchored pattern.
- Conversation timeline now labels deterministic post-generation pipeline stages (dedup, assertion enhancement, validation) as `agent: "system"` instead of `agent: "author"`. Pre-fix mechanical post-processing surfaced under the same lane as actual LLM author dispatches, making it impossible to tell from the timeline which steps incurred AI cost.
- Assertion enhancer's `HAS_PAGE_LOAD_ASSERTION_RE` no longer catastrophically backtracks on minified single-line test bodies. Same bounded-capture treatment as the test validator's `ASSERTION_RE` (separate fix), so the enhancer's fast-path stays linear-time on large inputs.
- Assertion enhancer's `STRONG_ASSERTION_PATTERNS` are now anchored to method-call syntax (`.toHaveURL(`) instead of bare substrings (`toHaveURL`). Defence-in-depth alongside the strings/comments strip pass — property assignments and identifiers named after matchers no longer false-positive as real assertions.
- Quality-score rubric (`scoreTestWithFactors`) now strips string literals and comments before running the substring checks, so a `// TODO: use getByRole` comment or a `'toHaveURL'` log string no longer earns the matching factor reward. Same class of bug the assertion-enhancer fix #14 addressed; both call sites now share `utils/codeStripping.js`.
- Test validator's `ACTION_CALL_RE` now validates method calls on chained-receiver identifiers (`download`, `response`, `mouse`, `keyboard`, `touchscreen`, `worker`, `coverage`). Pre-fix typos like `download.savAs(...)` or `keyboard.prees(...)` slipped through silently; post-fix they're flagged as invalid Playwright methods alongside the existing receivers.
- **UX-001** — Saving Auto-Approval, Quality Gates, Web Vitals, Coverage, and project/workspace settings now shows a visible confirmation toast on success and a red error toast on failure. Previously these mutations were silent or routed to the notification bell. (#40)
- **UX-001** — Approve / reject / restore / delete actions on Tests, Review Queue, Test Detail, and Project Detail now show success and error toasts. (#40)
- Bulk approve / reject on Review Queue now reports the actual number of tests affected (previously inflated when a multi-test project group failed). (#40)

### Added

- **AUTO-014** — Tests can declare dependencies so prerequisite tests run first and downstream tests are skipped with clear upstream-failure badges.
- Workspace-wide save/update/delete confirmations via a global toast surface. Success toasts dismiss after 3.5 s, errors after 5 s, and toasts with an action button (e.g. Undo) linger 5 s. Toasts have a manual dismiss × button. (#40)
- **A11Y** — Toasts announce to screen readers via `role="alert"` (errors) and `role="status"` (success / info). (#40)
- **UX** — Bulk approve / reject on Review Queue now offers an inline **Undo** action on the success toast that restores affected tests to Draft. (#40)

### Changed

- **Refactor** — Test Lab page decomposed into smaller components, hooks, and utility modules. No behaviour change. (#40)

- **SEC / Perf** — Web fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono) self-hosted instead of loaded from Google Fonts CDN — closes a GDPR exposure, unblocks CSP hardening, and removes a ~120 ms render-blocking external request on cold loads. (#40)

- **Security** — Defence-in-depth HTML sanitization on AI-generated markdown rendered in AI Chat, Chat History, and Step Results — guards against future grammar changes accidentally introducing an XSS sink. (#40)

- **UI** — Code preview on Review Queue now correctly labels generated Playwright code as "JavaScript" (was mislabelled "TypeScript"). (#40)

- **UX** — Empty states on Reports and on the Project Detail review tab now coach the user toward the next action (create a project, run regression, generate more tests, audit approvals, or clear filters) instead of showing bare text. (#40)

- **A11Y-001** — Global `:focus-visible` 2 px outline on all interactive elements (WCAG 2.4.7 / 2.4.11).
- **A11Y-002** — `ModalShell` and `RecorderModal` focus traps with `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, and focus-return on close (WCAG 2.1.2).
- **A11Y-004** — `--text3` lifted from `#9ca3af` (2.8:1) to `#6b7280` (4.6:1) for WCAG AA contrast compliance.
- **A11Y-006** — Descriptive `alt` text on test-result screenshots and visual-diff images (WCAG 1.1.1).
- **MOB-002** — Touch targets on named offenders (icon buttons, sidebar nav items, filter chips) raised to 44 px minimum under `@media (pointer: coarse)`.
- **Task 3** — Multi-agent conversation feed (`<AgentConversation>`) replacing `NarrativeFeed` with streamed chat-style turns, per-agent colour palette, ARIA `role="log"`, and a synthesizer/event-driven adapter fallback.
- **Task 2** — `run_agent_events` table (migration `057`) with `emitAgentEvent` helper; SSE snapshot hydrates the full event history on reconnect.

### Changed

- AI Provider default probe timeout raised from 10 s to 30 s; configurable via `AI_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS` (clamp `[1 s, 5 min]`).
- Settings IA: `providers` and `provider_routes` tabs merged into a single `ai_providers` section; old paths redirect for deep-link compatibility.

### Fixed

- `detectProvider` sticky-fallback role leak: roleless callers no longer match role-scoped sticky entries and vice versa.
- `toDisplayRoute` now uses a static `FAMILY_DISPLAY_LABEL` map instead of reading `process.env` model overrides.
- `PATCH /settings/ai-providers/:id` now emits an operator activity log entry on every provider update.
- Test Lab — switching projects no longer detaches an in-flight run; project sidebar and run view are now decoupled.
- Test Lab — keyboard activation (`Enter`/`Space`) and ARIA tablist pattern added to project sidebar and tab bar (WCAG 2.1.1).
- Test Lab — Retry button on failed/aborted runs re-uses persisted `dialsConfig` and `environmentId` without requiring form re-entry.
- Test Lab — completion banner now derives a per-outcome draft vs. auto-approved split and shows the correct CTA.
- AUTO-023 follow-up — `projectRepo` wires `oracleEnabled`/`reviewerEnabled`/`oracleMaxCostUsdPerRun`/`reviewerMaxCostUsdPerRun` through all CRUD paths (migration `058`).
- AUTO-023 follow-up — `PIPELINE_STEP_ROLES` corrected: step 6 → `oracle`, step 7 → `reviewer`.
- Task 2 / Task 3 — `AgentConversation` now consumes `agent_event` SSE pushes; SSE snapshot dedupes `agentEvents` hydration; per-event `model` field populated via lazy `resolveRoute`; account erasure and run-retry paths now cascade into `run_agent_events`.
- `stageStatus` recognises `interrupted` as a terminal state; no stage pulses indefinitely after a server restart.
- Feedback-loop regeneration now re-scores `playwrightCode`, writes a `reviewComment`, and clears stale approval provenance.
- Quality Insights — bot-blocked runs classified as `BOT_BLOCK` (not a selector failure) and excluded from auto-regeneration.
- Notification bell `[object Object]` display fixed; non-string `title`/`body` values coerced at write time.
- Audit Log — `audit.read` and `audit.export` rows hidden from the default view; opt-in via an "Audit reads" checkbox.
- MOB-001 — Page-level responsive polish for TestRunView grid, MFA enrollment, LLMStreamPanel, Recorder idle form, Systems page, NewProject form, and ApprovalsTimeline at 900/600/480 px breakpoints.
- ENT-004 — `activities.runId` column (migration `055`) enables per-run audit-log deep-links from RunDetail.
- ENT-004 — `tests.reviewComment` column (migration `054`) persists auto-regeneration explanations; surfaced as an amber callout on TestDetail.

---

## [1.8.0] — 2026-05-21
 
### Breaking
 
- **B2 — `agent_configs.provider` / `model` removed** (migration `048`). Dispatch now keys exclusively on `agent_configs.routeId`. Run `node backend/src/database/migrations/scripts/backfill-routes.js` (use `--dry-run` first) before deploying. `resolveProvider` is deleted; `resolveRoute` is the single dispatch path. The `AI_ROUTES_ENABLED` feature flag is removed.
### Added
 
- **B2.1** — Backfill script with `--dry-run`, `--workspace=<id>`, per-workspace transactions, API key encryption, and audit-log entries tagged `source: "backfill-routes"`.
- **B2.2** — Capability auto-probe (`POST /api/v1/settings/provider-routes/:id/probe`); fires automatically on every route upsert when routing-relevant fields change.
- **B2.3** — `resolveVisionModel` reads `route.capabilities.vision` from the probe; falls back to the `VISION_CAPABLE_MODELS` catalog when unset.
- **B2.4** — Per-route pricing: `computeCostForRoute(route, usage)` with 3-tier priority (`route.pricing` → `MODEL_PRICING` → null); `route_name` label on all AI Prometheus metrics.
- **B2.5** — Per-request AI log with PII redaction (migration `047`/`049`): three storage modes per workspace (`none` / `redacted` / `full`), built-in redactors, custom regex rules, and a replay endpoint.
- **B3.1** — Provider Routes Settings tab with per-row CRUD, inline `ProbeBadge`, Rotate key panel, fallback cycle preview, import/export bar, and workspace spend-caps panel.
- **B3.3** — `GET`/`POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE /api/v1/settings/provider-routes` with admin gate; DELETE returns 409 when an `agent_configs.routeId` references the route.
- **B3.5** — JSON import/export for provider routes; schema at `docs/schema/provider-routes-v1.json`.
- **B3.6** — Key rotation endpoint; probe-before-persist gate; clears route circuit breakers on success.
- **B3.7** — Workspace rate limits and spend caps (migration `050`): token-bucket limiter (Redis-atomic + in-memory fallback), `checkAndReserve`/`reportActual`, rolling spend check; spend alert at configurable threshold.
- **B3.8** — Response caching (migration `051`): SHA-256 cache key, TTL, thundering-herd coalescing, and cache hit/miss/savings Prometheus metrics.
- **B3.9** — Provider route audit log viewer (`GET /api/v1/settings/provider-routes/audit`); 90-day retention sweep.
- **B3.10** — Compat-slot migration script (`compat-to-routes.js`) with `--dry-run` and `--delete-source`.
- **B4.1** — All dispatch paths route through `protocolAdapter.generate`/`.stream`/`.generateVision`; legacy `adapterFor` switch removed from production paths.
- **B4.2** — Observability pivoted to `sum by (provider, route_name)`; two new alerts: `AiSpendCapExceeded` and `AiQuotaRejectionRateHigh`.
- **B4.3** — Migration `053` drops deprecated `agent_configs.fallbackRole`; route-level `fallbackRouteId` is canonical.
- **B4.5** — Load tests for dispatch overhead (p99 < 5 ms) and cache throughput (10 k reads + 1 k writes < 5 s).
- **B4.6** — Route groups (migration `054`): `route_groups` + `route_group_members` tables; `routeGroupResolver.js` supports `weighted`, `latency`, and `cost` strategies; `resolveRoute` delegates transparently when `routeId` starts with `rg-`.
- **B1.x** — Per-workspace `provider_routes` + `provider_route_audit` tables (migrations `035`/`036`); AES-256-GCM encrypted API keys with a 5-minute plaintext cache; `protocolAdapter.js` route-driven entry point; `resolveRoute` four-step priority chain; `AI_ROUTES_ENABLED` feature flag (default off).
- **AI-005** — Multi-agent dispatch: `generateText`/`streamText` accept `agentRole`/`workspaceId`; circuit breakers and sticky fallbacks keyed per `(provider, agentRole)`; AI Prometheus metrics gain an `agent_role` label; vision-heal routed through `agentRole="healer"`.
- **AI-003** — Per-call AI cost tracking via `MODEL_PRICING` catalog; `computeCostUsd` returns `null` for catalog misses; `app_ai_cost_usd_total{provider, operation}` counter bumped on every generation and vision-heal call.
- **AUTO-009** — Browser JS coverage capture per run; `coverageSummary` aggregation; Dashboard Coverage panel; per-project `coverageEnabled`/`sourcemapBaseUrl` controls.
- **AUTO-009k** — Two-stage per-shard coverage merge (pre-aggregate per shard → set-union in finalizer); strips raw `jsCoverage` from `runs.results` after merge.
- **MNT-001** — Vision-based locator healing: stage 7 pixelmatch (sliding-window RGBA comparison) and stage 8 LLM vision (`callVisionModel`); per-project opt-in with daily call cap and monthly USD budget circuit-breaker.
- **AUTO-022** — AI eval harness: deterministic scorer (selector/action/assertion, Levenshtein), golden-set baselines, CI regression gate (>5% aggregate drop exits non-zero), Dashboard trend panel, and `--persist` flag for `metric_samples`.
- **INF-007** — Production observability: OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation, `AsyncLocalStorage` request correlation (`X-Request-Id`/`traceId`/`spanId`), Prometheus `/metrics` (14 metrics), Sentry crash reporting, and 11 Prometheus alert rules.
### Changed
 
- **B1.x** — Per-workspace provider routes foundation established; `agent_configs.routeId` optional column (migration `037`); legacy `provider`-column shim kept active while `routeId` is null.
- **INF-007** — `app_ai_provider_tokens_total`, `app_ai_provider_latency_seconds`, and `app_ai_provider_errors_total` gain an `operation` label (default `"generation"`). Update Grafana queries to filter by `operation` to split generation vs. vision-heal series.
- **AI-002** — `backend/src/aiProvider.js` refactored into a module layout (`aiProvider/index`, `registry`, `retry`, `modelCatalog`, protocol adapters); thin re-export shim left in place.
### Fixed
 
- **AUTO-009j** — Retention sweep now nulls `shardCoverageSummaries` and `changedFileRanges` columns in addition to `coverageSummary`.
- **AUTO-009d** — Sharded PR-coverage gate now resolves `perSource` bundle URLs through the source-map resolver before intersecting with `changedFileRanges`.
- **AUTO-009d** — `sourceMapStatus` accuracy: resolver probe now runs for all sharded runs with `sourcemapBaseUrl` configured, not only PR-triggered runs.
- **AUTO-009d** — `QualityGatesPanel` `maxCoverageRegressionPct` help text corrected: `0` means "fail on any drop", blank disables.
### Security
 
- **AUTO-009h** — `file://` server-coverage paths validated for `..` traversal and optional prefix allowlist via `COVERAGE_FILE_PATH_PREFIX` env var; runtime re-validates for defence-in-depth.
---

## [1.7.3] — 2026-05-16
 
### Added
 
- **SEC-007** — Compliance audit log: `GET /api/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/audit-log` with cursor pagination, CSV/NDJSON export, export rate limiter (10/15 min), and an optional SHA-256 prevHash tamper-verification endpoint.
- **SEC-007** — Eight new auth activity types (`auth.login`, `auth.login.failed`, `auth.logout`, `auth.password.reset`, `auth.role.change`, `auth.api_key.create`, `auth.api_key.revoke`, `auth.session.revoke`) capturing `ip` and `User-Agent`.
- **SEC-007** — Meta-audit: reading or exporting the audit log emits `audit.read` / `audit.export` rows (PCI-DSS 10.2.6 / SOC 2 CC7.2).
- **SEC-007** — Event dedup: consecutive identical read-shaped events within `AUDIT_DEDUP_WINDOW_SEC` (default 60 s) collapse into one row with `count++`/`lastAt`; disabled when `AUDIT_HASH_CHAIN=true` (migration `034`).
- **SEC-007 Part C** — SIEM forwarder: `dispatchSiemEvent` pushes each audit row as NDJSON with HMAC-SHA256 signature; 3× retry with backoff; 4xx responses written to `audit_dlq`; per-workspace config endpoint (`GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE /api/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/siem-config`).
- **SEC-006** — PII firewall in the generation pipeline: emails, phones, SSNs, payment cards (Luhn-checked), JWTs, and auth tokens redacted before prompt construction; `pipeline.pii_redacted` audit rows emitted.
- **SEC-004** — Multi-factor authentication: TOTP enrollment (QR code, encrypted secret), 8-character recovery codes (SHA-256 hashed), WebAuthn/passkey support (Touch ID / Windows Hello / YubiKey), per-workspace MFA enforcement with 0–90 day grace period, and JWT `amr` claim.
- Scalable BullMQ worker pool with queue-depth, active/idle worker, and job-count dashboard metrics; falls back to single-process mode when Redis is unavailable.
- Recorder stealth mode (`stealth: true`) to bypass common headless-browser detection.
- Recorder device profiles (iPhone 14, Pixel 7, iPad Pro, etc.) selectable at session launch or mid-session.
- Recorder element picker: click any canvas element to auto-populate the selector field.
- Recorder `assertCount` and `assertHasClass` assertion kinds.
- Recorder pause, resume, and undo of the last captured step.
### Changed
 
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` returns `{ mfaRequired: true, pendingToken, methods }` when MFA is enrolled; auth cookie issued only after a successful `/auth/mfa/verify` or WebAuthn exchange. (SEC-004)
- `PATCH /api/v1/workspaces/current` accepts `mfaRequired` and `mfaGracePeriodDays` fields. (SEC-004)
- Worker concurrency reads `WORKER_CONCURRENCY` env var (with `MAX_WORKERS` as fallback).
### Fixed
 
- `render.yaml` Dockerfile path corrected for Render deployments.
### Security
 
- **SEC-006** — Per-project `strictPiiFirewall` and `piiAllowlist` controls.
- **SEC-004** — TOTP secrets AES-256-GCM encrypted; recovery codes SHA-256 hashed, compared with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`; pending-MFA tokens are single-use with 5-minute TTL; per-IP rate limits on enroll/verify endpoints.
- **SEC-007** — Recorder credential redaction: password fields, OTP codes, card numbers, and `data-sentri-secret` fields redacted before storage; generated tests reference `process.env.SENTRI_SECRET_N`.
---

## [1.7.2] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- **AUTO-010** — Root cause clustering: Run Detail now groups failed tests by shared error fingerprint, URL, and selector in a collapsible "Root Cause Summary" panel to reduce triage overhead.
- **CAP-002** — Distributed test sharding: test runs can be split across multiple parallel workers with `shards: N`. Results, quality gates, Web Vitals evaluation, GitHub Check Runs, and CI callbacks are finalized exactly once when all shards complete.
- **DIF-012** — Multi-environment support: projects now support named environments (e.g. staging, production) each with their own base URL and optional credentials. Any run or CI trigger can target a specific environment without modifying the project.
- **CAP-001** — Data-driven test fixtures: upload CSV or JSON fixture files per test to execute one iteration per row. Each iteration result records its fixture row for precise failure attribution.

---

## [1.7.1] — 2026-05-13

### Added
- **AUTO-004** — Impact analysis: CI trigger runs can accept `changedFiles[]` (or auto-fetch changed files from a GitHub PR) to scope execution to only the affected tests; unaffected tests are recorded as `skipped_no_impact`.
- **INT-002b** — GitHub App integration: admins can launch the install flow from Settings; uninstall and repository-removal webhooks automatically disable stale PR check configurations.
- **INT-002** — GitHub Check Runs: projects can opt in to native GitHub PR Check Runs reporting test results, quality gates, and Web Vitals directly on pull requests.
- **AUTO-001** — Risk-based test ordering: tests are ordered by risk score (pass-rate history, recency, self-heal frequency, changed pages) before each run. An optional `budgetMinutes` cap truncates low-risk tests; smoke tests always run first.
- **AI-001** — OpenAI-compatible provider slots: any provider speaking the OpenAI API wire format (DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, xAI, local LiteLLM, etc.) can be configured as a custom AI provider in Settings.
- AI provider config caching reduces database reads on high-volume pipeline runs; Redis pub/sub invalidates stale entries across instances.

### Security
- **INT-002b** — GitHub App installation IDs are now AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest for SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / HIPAA compliance.

---

## [1.7.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- **AUTO-002 / AUTO-015** — Diff-aware crawling: crawl runs compare against a stored baseline and scope test generation to changed pages only; no-change crawls complete without regenerating tests. Vercel and Netlify deployment webhooks trigger preview crawls automatically, with a "Last deployment run" badge in the project header.
- **AUTO-003b** — Confidence-based auto-approval: projects can set an `autoApproveThreshold` (0–1) so high-confidence AI-generated tests are approved without manual review. An `DISABLE_AUTO_APPROVAL` env var overrides all thresholds at runtime without a redeploy.
- **AUTO-017.3** — Web Vitals trend charts: Project Quality card now shows LCP, CLS, INP, and TTFB trend charts per run with threshold lines from project budgets.
- **CAP-004** — Healing Dashboard: new `/healing` page shows self-healing telemetry — per-strategy success rates, top healed selectors, and a savings trend chart.
- **MET-001** — Metric samples time-series: backend records and exposes time-series data for trend chart rendering.
- **PR-7** — Review Queue: new `/review-queue` page for approving and rejecting AI-generated tests across all projects. Two-pane layout with sort, search, category filter, multi-select, bulk actions, keyboard shortcuts (`a` approve, `r` reject, `j`/`k` navigate), and deep-linkable URL state.
- Review Queue accessibility: tab bar, checkboxes, list rows, and quality bar now meet WAI-ARIA authoring-practice requirements.
- Review Queue mobile layout: narrow viewports use a single-pane back-to-list pattern.
- Quality score factor breakdown: quality score chip and bar are now expandable to show the individual scoring factors (e.g. `+20 URL assertion`, `−30 No assertions`).
- Run comparison: `GET /api/v1/runs/:runId/compare/:otherRunId` and a Run Detail **Compare** action show a side-by-side diff of flipped, added, removed, and unchanged test outcomes across two runs. (#AUTO-019)
- Embedded Playwright trace viewer: Run Detail now has an **Open Trace** action that loads the Playwright trace viewer directly in the browser; ZIP download remains available as fallback. (#DIF-005)
- **AUTO-017** — Web Vitals budgets: per-project LCP / CLS / INP / TTFB budget configuration with evaluation on every run completion; gate results are included in CI trigger responses and callbacks.
- OpenRouter provider support: set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to route generation through OpenRouter's 200+ model gateway. Streaming, retries, circuit breaker, and rate-limit fallback all apply.
- Automation page restructured into four tabs — Triggers & Schedules, Quality Gates, Integrations, Snippets — with live status chips per project.
- **CAP-003** — AI-generated test code is now scanned for accidentally leaked secrets (AWS keys, JWTs, Bearer tokens) before persistence; flagged tests are rejected and the run is marked `secretScanBlocked`.
- XSS fix: AI-supplied attribute values in the DOM-tree renderer are now HTML-escaped before rendering.
- No-orphan-routes CI guard: PRs that add a backend route without a frontend consumer fail the build.

### Fixed
- `activityRepo.getFiltered` now correctly honours `limit: 0` instead of returning 200 rows.
- Review Queue search input debounced to 300ms — was firing a server request on every keystroke.
- Reject and delete actions in the Review Queue now require confirmation before executing.
- Rejected tests now restore to Draft (not directly to Approved) to re-enter the review queue.
- Journey category filter now filters server-side — pagination totals and tab counts previously reflected the unfiltered dataset.
- Sidebar draft-count badge now invalidates on approve/reject mutations — previously stayed stale for up to 60 seconds.
- Per-test video artifacts are now matched by path instead of directory index — prevents wrong-video attachments on filesystems that return files in non-creation order.

### Removed
- Sprint promotion scripts (`scripts/promote-sprint-item.mjs`) — the manual checklist in `REVIEW.md` is now the canonical hand-off process. (#PROC-002, #PROC-003)
- Dead code left over from the Review Queue migration removed from `Tests.jsx` and `ProjectDetail.jsx`.

---

## [1.6.10] — 2026-05-01

### Added
- **AUTO-016** — Accessibility scanning: every crawled page is scanned with axe-core and violations are persisted per run; CrawlView shows a per-page violation panel and the Dashboard includes a "Top Accessibility Offenders" rollup.
- **DIF-007** — "Edit with AI" panel on Test Detail: describe a change in plain language and receive a diff of the updated Playwright test code with one-click apply.
- **MNT-006** — Object storage abstraction: screenshots, videos, and traces can now be stored in any S3-compatible backend (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO) by setting `STORAGE_BACKEND=s3`.
- **AUTO-006** — Network condition simulation: test runs accept `networkCondition: "fast" | "slow3g" | "offline"` to reproduce real-world network scenarios.
- **AUTO-005** — Automatic per-test retry with flake isolation: failed tests are retried up to `MAX_TEST_RETRIES` times (default 2) before recording a true failure. `retryCount` and `failedAfterRetry` are persisted per run for analytics.
- Standalone Playwright export: `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/export/playwright` returns a runnable Playwright project ZIP of all approved tests. (#DIF-006)
- **AUTO-012** — Quality gates: per-project pass-rate, flakiness, and failure-count thresholds; violations are included in run results and CI trigger responses.
- **ENH-036b** — Auto-detect login form fields during crawl: users supply only username and password — CSS selector configuration is no longer required.
- **INF-006** — Root `render.yaml` Blueprint for one-click Render deployment with persistent disk.
- Collapsible sidebar: toggle between full-width and icon-rail mode; state persists across reloads.
- **ENH-036** — Edit existing projects: `PATCH /api/v1/projects/:id` lets admins update name, URL, and credentials without re-entering saved secrets.
- DIF-013 — Anonymous opt-out telemetry via PostHog; disable with `SENTRI_TELEMETRY=0` or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`.

### Fixed
- Playwright export no longer double-wraps spec files that already contain a complete `import` + `test()` structure. (#DIF-006)

### Security
- **CAP-003** — Secret scanner gate on AI-generated test code. (#12)
- XSS: attribute values in the DOM-tree renderer are now HTML-escaped. (#2)

---

## [1.6.9] — 2026-04-30

### Added
- Anonymous opt-out PostHog telemetry covering install, crawl, generate, run, review, and healing events; no PII collected. Disable with `SENTRI_TELEMETRY=0`. (#DIF-013)
- Per-run network condition simulation (`fast` / `slow3g` / `offline`) with selector in the Run Regression modal. (#AUTO-006)
- Automatic per-test retry and flake isolation; configurable via `MAX_TEST_RETRIES`. (#AUTO-005)
- Playwright project ZIP export for all approved tests. (#DIF-006)
- Conversational test editor — "Edit with AI" panel on Test Detail. (#DIF-007)
- S3-compatible object storage for screenshots, videos, and traces. (#MNT-006)
- Accessibility scanning on every crawled page with axe-core; violations visible in CrawlView and the Dashboard. (#AUTO-016)

---

## [1.6.8] — 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- Recorder canvas is now interactive — pointer, keyboard, and scroll events are forwarded to the headless browser; recording no longer returns "no actions captured". (#DIF-015)
- Recorder SSE screencast frames now paint reliably on the canvas. (#DIF-015)
- Re-recording a project after a crashed session no longer fails with a UNIQUE constraint error. (#DIF-015)
- Timed-out recorder sessions now close their stub run row, unblocking future runs on the project. (#DIF-015)
- Generated Playwright code and the human-readable Step list are now in sync after recording. (#DIF-015)
- Typing in the recorder canvas no longer produces doubled characters. (#DIF-015)
- Right- and middle-button mouse drags now forward the correct button to CDP. (#DIF-015)
- Scrolling inside the recorder canvas no longer scrolls the host page underneath. (#DIF-015)
- Step labels now use plain English (e.g. "User clicks the 'Sign in' button") instead of raw selectors. (#DIF-015)
- Adjacent navigations that differ only by query string are now collapsed into a single step. (#DIF-015)
- Recording sessions now support inline assertion steps (visible / text / value / URL), double-click, right-click, hover, and file-upload actions. (#DIF-015)

---

## [1.6.7] — 2026-04-26

### Changed
- Visual baselines are now browser-aware: baseline storage keys include the Playwright engine (chromium / firefox / webkit) so cross-browser runs no longer diff against Chromium goldens. (#DIF-002b)

---

## [1.6.x] — 2026-04-17 – 2026-04-25

### Added
- Recorder selector engine upgraded to delegate to Playwright's own `InjectedScript`-based generator for ancestor scoring, shadow-DOM traversal, and iframe locator chains. (#DIF-015b)
- `selectorGenerator` now appends `>> nth=N` when a CSS selector matches multiple elements. (#DIF-015b)
- UI login→dashboard and project-create E2E specs. (#QA)

### Fixed
- BullMQ worker no longer writes terminal state (failed status, activity log, SSE event) on non-final retry attempts. (#INF-003)
- Aborting a BullMQ-backed run now correctly signals the worker instead of only updating the database. (#INF-003)
- GDPR account export now includes run logs stored in the `run_logs` table. (#SEC-003)
- SPA CSP nonce injection now works in multi-container deployments via a shared Docker volume. (#SEC-002)
- State-explorer crawl fingerprinting now includes UI component inventory and SPA framework detection for better state discrimination. (#96)
- Per-URL state cap scales with structural diversity, allowing multi-step wizards to be fully explored. (#96)
- Link-crawl journey graph correctly resolves pages with significant query parameters. (#96)
- `notificationSettingsRepo` now returns boolean `enabled` instead of integer `0/1`. (#FEA-001)

### Security
- Content Security Policy: `'unsafe-inline'` replaced with per-request cryptographic nonce. (#SEC-002)
- Notification webhook URLs validated with full SSRF protection at write time and fetch time. (#FEA-001)
- Account export strips `passwordHash` from the payload. (#SEC-003)

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **SEC-001** — Email verification on registration: new users must verify their address before signing in; verification emails sent via Resend, SMTP, or console fallback.
- **INF-001** — PostgreSQL support: set `DATABASE_URL=postgres://…` to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite; all repositories work unchanged via a shared adapter interface.
- **INF-002** — Redis support for rate limiting, token revocation, and SSE pub/sub; falls back to in-memory stores when `REDIS_URL` is unset.
- Docker Compose profiles for optional PostgreSQL (`--profile postgres`) and Redis (`--profile redis`) services.

### Fixed
- OAuth login with a previously-registered unverified email now auto-verifies the account. (#SEC-001)
- Redis rate-limit store initialises after the connection event fires — fixes a startup race condition. (#INF-002)
- PostgreSQL adapter correctly handles string literals containing `@`, `?`, or `LIKE`/`like` — prevents false parameter substitution. (#INF-001)
- PostgreSQL adapter splits multi-statement DDL into individual statements. (#INF-001)
- PostgreSQL adapter uses `AsyncLocalStorage` for concurrency-safe transaction routing. (#INF-001)
- PostgreSQL adapter auto-reconnects on connection loss. (#INF-001)

### Security
- Login blocked for unverified email accounts — returns `403 EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED`. (#SEC-001)

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added
- **ENH-008** — Dedicated `run_logs` table: log lines are single-row INSERTs with a monotonic sequence counter, replacing the previous O(n²) JSON read-modify-write on `runs.logs`.
- **ENH-011** — CI/CD webhook trigger: `POST /api/projects/:id/trigger` (Bearer token authenticated) returns `202 Accepted` with a `statusUrl` for polling and optional `callbackUrl` for push notification on completion.
- Per-project trigger token management: create (plaintext shown once), list, and revoke tokens via the API.
- Dedicated Automation page (`/automation`) with per-project CI/CD tokens, scheduled runs, integration snippets, and deep-link support.
- **ENH-006** — Cron-based test scheduling: configure automated regression runs per project with a 5-field cron expression and IANA timezone; schedules survive restarts and are hot-reloaded on save.
- **ENH-030** — Gitleaks secrets scanning CI job gates all PRs and pushes to `main` before any build proceeds.
- Client-side error reporting: `ErrorBoundary` reports crashes to `POST /api/system/client-error` for server-side logging.

### Changed
- Run log lines persisted to `run_logs` table instead of the `runs.logs` JSON column; `runRepo.getById()` hydrates `run.logs` automatically — no API change for callers.

### Fixed
- `callbackUrl` webhook now fires on any terminal state (completed, failed, aborted) — previously only fired on success, leaving CI pipelines unnotified on failure.
- Scheduler timezone conversion uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat.formatToParts()` — fixes DST transition edge cases.
- Scheduled runs now respect the `PARALLEL_WORKERS` env var.
- `waitFor` added to the valid page-action whitelist — prevents false rejection of tests using `locator.waitFor()`.
- `DeleteProjectModal` warns about permanently destroyed CI/CD tokens and schedules before confirming deletion.

### Security
- Artifact URLs (screenshots, videos, traces) are now HMAC-signed with a configurable TTL; requires `ARTIFACT_SECRET` in production. (#ENH-007)
- Secrets scanning gates the entire CI pipeline. (#ENH-030)

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- **ENH-020** — Soft delete & Recycle Bin: deleting tests, projects, or runs moves them to a recoverable Recycle Bin; items can be restored or permanently purged from Settings.
- **ENH-010** — Server-side pagination on `GET /api/projects/:id/tests`, `GET /api/tests`, and `GET /api/projects/:id/runs` via `?page=N&pageSize=N`.
- Lightweight `GET /api/projects/:id/tests/counts` endpoint returning per-status counts without fetching row data. (#ENH-010)
- **ENH-024** — Vendor bundle splitting (React, recharts, lucide-react, jspdf emitted as separate cacheable chunks) and animated page skeleton loader for lazily-loaded routes.
- Full-page AI Chat at `/chat` with persistent sessions — create, rename, delete, search, and export as Markdown or JSON. (#83)

### Changed
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id`, `DELETE /api/projects/:id/tests/:testId`, and bulk delete now soft-delete to the Recycle Bin instead of permanently destroying data. (#ENH-020)
- Chat session storage scoped by user ID to prevent cross-account data leakage. (#83)

### Fixed
- Admin "Clear all run history" permanently removes runs — does not soft-delete to the Recycle Bin. (#ENH-020)
- Project cascade-restore only recovers items deleted at the same time as the project; individually-deleted items remain in the Recycle Bin. (#ENH-020)
- Cascade soft-delete is now transactional so all child entities share the same `deletedAt` timestamp. (#ENH-020)
- Project Detail filter pills, tab badges, and Run button state now reflect server-side totals instead of the current page only. (#ENH-010)
- "Tests generated" count in the paginated runs listing no longer shows "—". (#ENH-010)

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- AI provider API keys are persisted to the database (AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest) and restored on startup — no longer lost on restart or redeployment. (#ENH-004)

### Security
- Artifact serving moved from public static files to HMAC-signed expiring URLs; requires `ARTIFACT_SECRET` env var in production. (#ENH-007)
- Gitleaks secrets scanning gates the entire CI pipeline. (#ENH-030)

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- Three-tier global rate limiting: general (300 req / 15 min), expensive operations (20 / hr), and AI generation (30 / hr). (#78)
- Password reset via `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` and `POST /api/auth/reset-password` with database-backed tokens that survive server restarts. (#78)
- Per-user audit trail: every activity log entry now records the acting user's identity. (#78)
- **S1-02** — Cookie-based auth: JWT moved from `localStorage` to HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies; CSRF double-submit cookie on all mutating endpoints.
- Session refresh: `POST /api/auth/refresh` endpoint; frontend refreshes proactively 5 minutes before expiry.
- Responsive layout: sidebar collapses at 768px; off-screen drawer at 480px.
- Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+K`): fuzzy-search commands (Mode 1) with AI chat fallback (Mode 2); prefix `>` for commands, `?` for AI.
- Confirm password field and frontend email validation on the registration form.
- OAuth CSRF protection via state parameter validation.
- VitePress documentation site and GitHub Pages SPA routing.

### Fixed
- Password reset tokens now persisted in the database — survive server restarts and multi-instance deployments. (#78)
- Atomic token claim prevents concurrent replay of the same password reset token. (#78)
- Single-test-run endpoint now uses the expensive-operations rate limiter instead of the AI-generation limiter. (#78)

### Removed
- `CodeEditorModal.jsx` — deprecated component with no consumers.

### Security
- Password reset tokens use a one-time atomic claim — concurrent requests cannot both succeed. (#78)
- Only the latest password reset token per user is valid; requesting a new one invalidates all prior unused tokens. (#78)
- JWT stored in HttpOnly cookies — never exposed to JavaScript, eliminating XSS-based token theft. (#S1-02)
- CSRF double-submit cookie (`_csrf`) on all POST / PATCH / PUT / DELETE endpoints. (#S1-02)
- OAuth state parameter validated before code exchange.
- JWT fallback secret replaced with random per-process generation.
- `verifyJwt` hardened with explicit buffer length check.
